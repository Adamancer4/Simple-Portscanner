# Simple-Portscanner

This is a very simple Port scanner created using Python 3.9. 

It scans the first 100 ports of the target IP Address or target host name. 

You can scan multiple Ip Addresses and/or website addresses simultaneously. 

There is a 1-second interval between port scans. 

This is my very first project on Github. Enjoy!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, you need to download the Python Library, "IPy"

Do this by typing - 
```Sudo apt install python3-ipy```


Next, type or copy/paste the below code in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/Adamancer4/Simple-Portscanner.git```



Now, just change directories and execute the .py file

Reminder: You can execute this file by using linux terminal.


Next, go into the terminal and type:

 ```cd Simple-Portscanner```

Use this method below to launch the port scanner:

```python3 PortScanner1.py```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this doesn't run properly, try making the PortScanner1.py file executable. 
You do this by typing the below code:

```chmod +777 PortScanner1.py```

Finally, attempt to launch the file again by typing:

```python3 PortScanner1.py```


I hope you have fun with this. I had fun creating it.
